The field was on the verge of transitioning from psychodynamic psychiatry to biological psychiatry. During this period, nosology and etiology were confounded, and there was little diagnostic agreement across practitioners. Psychiatric admissions often lasted 6 months or more. Available treatments and conditions were sometimes harsh and iatrogenic: being housed with lobotomized people, rodent-infested municipal hospitals, prolonged periods in restraints and solitary confinement, cold wet sheets, high doses of neuroleptics or the withholding of medication, inadequate access to medication upon discharge, and even sexual misconduct by clinicians. This is also an account of resilience, the life-saving benefit of good treatment. It stresses the need to treat the persons trapped within the disease and to help clients become an active agent in their own recovery.

This effect depends on the target-to-mask distance. An improvement of stimulus detection can also be observed when participants imagine (i.e., retrieve from memory) the previously presented masks. In this double-blind, placebo-controlled study, we show that the gamma-aminobutyric acid-A (GABAA) receptor agonist alprazolam disrupts perceptual but not imagery enhancement of contrast detection in individuals with generalized anxiety and adjustment disorder. The weakened target detection at short target-to-mask distances became more pronounced after the administration of the GABA-agonist in both perception and imagery conditions. Healthy control participants did not differ from individuals with generalized anxiety and adjustment disorder receiving placebo. These results indicate that perception and imagery can be dissociated by boosting GABA-ergic neurotransmission. Further studies are warranted to investigate this effect in healthy individuals. \",\n          \"Evidence from prior public health emergencies demonstrates palliative care's importance to manage symptoms, make advance care plans, and improve end-of-life outcomes.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":7}],"source":["papers = pd.read_csv(f'{DATA_PATH}/papers_raw/final_papers.csv')\n","papers.head(5)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"d86a563f","metadata":{"id":"d86a563f"},"source":["## Get the entities from each model to find out which is the most suitable"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"id":"fc250e93","metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":105},"id":"fc250e93","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1713641023906,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":422,"user":{"displayName":"SAURAV KUMAR","userId":"02036774334123717013"}},"outputId":"32f92373-a0d7-40d8-aedd-4449bf28aa5e"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["'Although several lines of evidence support the hypothesis of a dysregulation of serotoninergic neurotransmission in the pathophysiology of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), there is also evidence for an involvement of other pathways such as the GABAergic, glutamatergic, and dopaminergic systems. Only recently, data obtained from a small number of animal studies alternatively suggested an involvement of the endocannabinoid system in the pathophysiology of OCD reporting beneficial effects in OCD-like behavior after use of substances that stimulate the endocannabinoid system. In humans, until today, only two case reports are available reporting successful treatment with dronabinol (tetrahydrocannabinol, THC), an agonist at central cannabinoid CB1 receptors, in patients with otherwise treatment refractory OCD. In addition, data obtained from a small open uncontrolled trial using the THC analogue nabilone suggest that the combination of nabilone plus exposure-based psychotherapy is more effective than each treatment alone. These reports are in line with data from a limited number of case studies and small controlled trials in patients with Tourette syndrome (TS), a chronic motor and vocal tic disorder often associated with comorbid obsessive compulsive behavior (OCB), reporting not only an improvement of tics, but also of comorbid OCB after use of different kinds of cannabis-based medicines including THC, cannabis extracts, and flowers. Here we present the case of a 22-year-old male patient, who suffered from severe OCD since childhood and significantly improved after treatment with medicinal cannabis with markedly reduced OCD and depression resulting in a considerable improvement of quality of life. In addition, we give a review of current literature on the effects of cannabinoids in animal models and patients with OCD and suggest a cannabinoid hypothesis of OCD.'"],"application/vnd.google.colaboratory.intrinsic+json":{"type":"string"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":8}],"source":["example_text = papers['Abstract'][1]\n","example_text"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"eaf8321b","metadata":{"id":"eaf8321b"},"source":["### EN_SCI_LG"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"id":"e1283fdc","metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":387},"id":"e1283fdc","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1713641028010,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":726,"user":{"displayName":"SAURAV KUMAR","userId":"02036774334123717013"}},"outputId":"b129ef9f-f5cc-421b-8f0c-c88691a8fdd0"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":["<IPython.core.display.HTML object>"],"text/html":["<span class=\"tex2jax_ignore\"><div class=\"entities\" style=\"line-height: 2.5;
