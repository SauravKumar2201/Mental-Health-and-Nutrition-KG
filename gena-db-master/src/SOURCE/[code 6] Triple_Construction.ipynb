And, the meaning of the combination PI and Pv-aCO(2)/Ca-vO(2) ratio to interpret incoherence of lactate clear was explored. Methods: The patients with sepsis were prospectively observed, who admitted to critically care medicine department of Peking Union Medical College Hospital. The hemodynamic parameters, simultaneous arterial and central venous blood gas analysis and PI were obtained at the enrollment (T0) and 8 hours (T8) during resuscitation. The lactate clearance was defined as 8h-LC\\u226510% and non-lactate clearance was defined as 8h-LC \\u2264 10%. Additionally, the patients were divided as three sub-groups according to the PI value at T8: the normalized PI group with PI\\u22651.4,the mild impaired PI with 1.4Results: A total of 84 patients were enrolled in this study. There was no significant difference in Pv-aCO(2)/Ca-vO(2) ratio in the three groups. However, the PI\\u22640.6 group had a significantly higher Pv-aCO(2) than other groups. Moreover, the patients with non-lactate clearance (13/32) had a higher Pv-aCO(2)/Ca-vO(2) ratio than the patients with lactate clearance in PI\\u22651.4 group (1.9\\u00b10.7 vs. 1.3\\u00b11.0, P=0.01). Multivariate analysis showed both Pv-aCO(2)/Ca-vO(2) ratio [Exp(B) 2.235, 95% CI 1.232-4.055, P=0.008] and acute physiology and chronic health evaluation \\u2161 (APACHE \\u2161) [Exp (B) 1.087, 95%CI 1.022-1.156, P=0.008] were independent risk factor of non-lactate clearance. 8h-PI was significantly negative correlated with the 8 h Pv-aCO(2) gap (r=-0.311, P=0.004), but not significantly with Pv-aCO(2)/Ca-vO(2) ratio (r=-0.094, P=0.385). Conclusions: Both high Pv-aCO(2)/Ca-vO(2) ratio and low PI were related to non-lactate clearance after resuscitation in sepsis. Combined PI and Pv-aCO(2)/Ca-vO(2) ratio could interpret incoherence of latacte clearance after resuscitation.\",\n          \"Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is manifested by a specific set of behavioral deficits such as hyperactivity, impulsivity, and inattention. The dopamine neurotransmitter system is postulated to be involved in the pathogenesis of ADHD. Guanfacine, a selective \\u03b12A-adrenoceptor agonist, is prescribed for ADHD treatment. ADHD also is known to be associated with impairment of multiple aspects of cognition, including spatial memory, however, it remains unclear how modulation of the norepinephrine system can affect these deficits. Hyperdopaminergic dopamine transporter knockout (DAT-KO) rats are a valuable model for investigating ADHD. The DAT-KO rats are hyperactive and deficient in spatial working memory. This work aimed to evaluate the effects of noradrenergic drugs on the fulfillment of spatial cognitive tasks by DAT-KO rats. The rats were tested in the Hebb - Williams maze during training and following noradrenergic drugs administration. The efficiency of spatial orientation was assessed as to how fast the animal finds an optimal way to the goal box. Testing in a new maze configuration allowed us to evaluate the effects of drug administration after the acquisition of the task rules. The behavioral variables such as the distance traveled, the time to reach the goal box, and the time spent in the error zones were analyzed. It has been observed that \\u03b12A-adrenoceptor agonist Guanfacine (0.25 mg/kg) had only a minimal inhibitory effect on hyperactivity of DAT-KO rats in the maze but significantly ameliorated their perseverative pattern of activity and reduced the time spent in the error zones. In contrast, \\u03b12A-adrenoceptor antagonist Yohimbine, at the dose of 1 mg/kg, increased the distance traveled by DAT-KO rats and elevated the number of perseverative reactions and the time spent in the error zones. Guanfacine caused minimal effects in wild-type rats, while Yohimbine altered several parameters reflecting a detrimental effect on the performance in the maze. These data indicate that modulation of \\u03b12A-adrenoceptor activity potently affects both dopamine-dependent hyperactivity and cognitive dysfunctions. Similar mechanisms may be involved in the beneficial effects of Guanfacine on cognitive deficits in ADHD patients. This study further supports the translational potential of DAT-KO rats for testing new pharmacological drugs.\",\n          \"The early phase of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by hippocampus-dependent memory deficits and impaired synaptic plasticity. Increasing evidence suggests that stress and dysregulation of the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, marked by the elevated circulating glucocorticoids, are risk factors for AD onset. How these changes contribute to early hippocampal dysfunction remains unclear. Using an elaborated version of the object recognition task, we carefully monitored alterations in key components of episodic memory, the first type of memory altered in AD patients, in early symptomatic Tg2576 AD mice. We also combined biochemical and ex vivo electrophysiological analyses to reveal novel cellular and molecular dysregulations underpinning the onset of the pathology. We show that HPA axis, circadian rhythm, and feedback mechanisms, as well as episodic memory, are compromised in this early symptomatic phase, reminiscent of human AD pathology. The cognitive decline could be rescued by subchronic in vivo treatment with RU486, a glucocorticoid receptor antagonist. These observed phenotypes were paralleled by a specific enhancement of N-Methyl-D-aspartic acid receptor (NMDAR)-dependent LTD in CA1 pyramidal neurons, whereas LTP and metabotropic glutamate receptor-dependent LTD remain unchanged. NMDAR transmission was also enhanced. Finally, we show that, as for the behavioral deficit, RU486 treatment rescues this abnormal synaptic phenotype. These preclinical results define glucocorticoid signaling as a contributing factor to both episodic memory loss and early synaptic failure in this AD mouse model, and suggest that glucocorticoid receptor targeting strategies could be beneficial to delay AD onset. \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\":
