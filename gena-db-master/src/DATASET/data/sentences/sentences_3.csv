23300105,"PG has been classified under ""Impulse-Control Disorders Not Elsewhere Classified,"" along with compulsive stealing (kleptomania), starting fires (pyromania) and hair-pulling (trichotillomania), but accumulative evidence suggests that PG has many similarities with substance use disorders."
23300105,"In this article, we review neuroimaging studies on PG on the basis of 4 dimensions - sensitivity to monetary reward and loss, craving and cue reactivity, impulsivity, and decision-making."
23300105,"In general, PG patients show reduced sensitivity to both monetary reward and loss, increased gamble-related cue reactivity, and increased impulsivity."

17611904,"Multiple regression analysis demonstrated that HOMA index was the only contributing factor to low urinary pH in gout patients, except for serum uric acid."
17611904,"Administrations of PPAR alpha agonists significantly raised 24-hour urine pH levels in gout patients in accordance with a reduction in serum triglyceride concentration, probably through their activities to improve insulin resistance."
17611904,Our results suggest that insulin resistance plays an important role in the development of low urinary pH in patients with gout and that PPAR alpha agonist is preferable for raising urinary pH of the gout patients with hypertriglyceridemia.

26030405,"Although glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β) signaling in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) plays a key role in mediating dopamine (DA)-dependent behaviors, there is less direct evidence that how VPA acts on the GSK3β signaling in the functionally distinct sub-regions of the NAc, the NAc core (NAcC) and the NAc shell (NAcSh), during psycho-stimulant-induced hyperactivity."
26030405,"We further investigated whether microinjection of VPA (300 μg/0.5 μl/side, once daily for 7 consecutive days) into NAcC or NAcSh could affect hyperactivity induced by MA."
26030405,"Our data indicated that repeated VPA treatment attenuated MA-induced hyperlocomotor, and the effect was associated with decreased levels of phosphorylated GSK3β at Ser 9 in the NAcC. Moreover, repeated bilateral intra-NAcC, but not intra-NAcSh VPA treatment, significantly attenuated MA-induced hyperactivity."
26030405,Our results suggested that GSK3β activity in NAcC contributes to the inhibitory effects of VPA on MA-induced hyperactivity.

3964838,Insulin-induced hypoglycemia in normothermic rats caused progressive neurological depression and differentially altered regional cerebral acetylcholine metabolism.
3964838,"Reductions of plasma glucose from 7.7 mM (control) to 2.5-1.7 mM (moderate hypoglycemia associated with decreased motor activity) or 1.5 mM (severe hypoglycemia with lethargy progressing to stupor) decreased glucose concentrations in the cerebral cortex, striatum, and hippocampus to less than 10% of control."
3964838,"Moderate hypoglycemia diminished acetylcholine concentrations in cortex and striatum (21% and 45%, respectively) and reduced [1-2H2, 2-2H2]choline incorporation into acetylcholine (62% and 41%, respectively)."
3964838,Severe hypoglycemia did not reduce the acetylcholine concentration or synthesis in cortex and striatum further.
3964838,"The concentrations of choline rose in the cortex (+53%) and striatum (+130%) of animals that became stuporous but a similar rise in [1-2H2, 2-2H2]choline left the specific activities of choline in these structures unchanged."
3964838,"In rats that developed hypoglycemic stupor and were then treated with glucose, the animals recovered apparently normal behavior, and the concentrations of acetylcholine and the incorporation of [1-2H2, 2-2H2]-choline into acetylcholine returned to control values in the striatum but not in the cerebral cortex."
3964838,"Thus, impaired acetylcholine metabolism in selected regions of the brain may contribute to the early symptoms of neurological dysfunction in hypoglycemia."
7463059,"During insulin stupor in mice, acetylcholine levels in cerebral cortex, cerebellum, brainstem, striatum, and hippocampus were unchanged from control values despite brain glucose concentrations 3-10% of normal, whereas choline levels rose 2.4-3.6-fold in all five CNS regions."
7463059,"The data suggest that, in hypoglycemic stupor, (1) overall rates of acetylcholine synthesis and degradation remain balanced within each of the CNS regions studied; (2) the biochemical mechanism that elevates brain choline levels is unlikely to be related only to cholinergic synaptic processes; and (3) brain choline levels need not rise for stupor to occur."

26404241,"We performed a review in order to evaluate the extant evidence regarding: (1) the association between intake and serum levels of tocopherols and tocotrienols and age-related pathologies (osteoporosis, sarcopenia and cognitive impairment); and (2) the optimum diet therapy or supplementation with tocopherols and tocotrienols for the treatment of these abnormalities."
26404241,"The optimum diet therapy in the elderly for avoiding vitamin E deficiency and its negative correlates, such as high inflammation and oxidation, must aim at achieving specific nutritional goals."
26404241,"These goals must be reached through: accession of the elderly subjects to specific personalized dietary programs aimed at achieving and/or maintaining body weight (avoid malnutrition); increase their intake of food rich in vitamin E, such as derivatives of oily seeds (in particular wheat germ oil), olive oil, hazelnuts, walnuts, almonds, and cereals rich in vitamin E (such as specific rice cultivar rich in tocotrienols) or take vitamin E supplements."
29019353,"Central to this success was the idea that to achieve best disease outcomes and minimize the development of drug resistance, at least three antiretroviral agents should be used for HIV treatment."
29019353,"In this Phase II, multicenter open-label study of 286 HIV-infected ARTnaïve patients, once-daily oral cabotegravir/abacavir/lamivudine achieved virologic suppression in 84% of study participants."
29019353,"Crucially, no drug resistance mutations were seen in study participants who remained on their regimen."
29019353,"While the idea of a two-drug regimen has been entertained for maintenance therapy, there may be little willingness to push this further into the area of antiretroviral treatment initiation, for the justifiable concerns that exist around the emergence of drug resistance."
29019353,"The regimen was well tolerated, with no reported drug resistance mutations while on treatment."
29019353,"There are many real-world advantages to a two-drug regimen approach, among them lower costs (crucial in resource-limited settings where affordability may be a limiting factor), fewer adverse effects or drug toxicities, and possibly improved compliance."

10074240,This research was to observe the effects of lithium chloride (LiCl) and Harringtonine (HT) on the proliferation and differentiation of HL-60 leukemia cells.
10074240,"The results obtained by liquid suspension culture, semi-solid colony culture and 3H-TdR incorporation into HL-60 cells indicated that different concentrations of LiCl (5-20 mmol/L) and HT (10(-8)-10(-5)mol/L) exerted the inhibitory effects in a dose-dependent manner on HL-60 cell proliferation respectively."
10074240,"When LiCl (10 mmol/L) and HT (10(-7) mol/L) were added together in the liquid culture or semi-solid culture of HL-60 cells, they showed much greater inhibitory effect than that by each agent separately."
10074240,It was discovered that there was induction of the differentiation of HL-60 cells by lithium and HT and the induction of HL-60 cells differentiation by HT was markedly enhanced by the addition of low concentration of lithium.
10074240,"This work also showed that by treating HL-60 cells with lithium and HT, the expression of the c-myc proto-oncogene was markedly decreased as measured by RT/PCR-mRNA (P < 0.01)."

10446739,Stimulation of serotonin-2 (5-HT2) receptors is thought to underlie insomnia and changes in sleep architecture seen with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs).
10446739,"On the other hand, antidepressant drugs with 5-HT2 blocking properties, such as mirtazapine or nefazodone, alleviate insomnia and improve sleep architecture."

25255070,"Buprenorphine and carprofen, 2 of the most commonly used analgesics in mice, must be administered every 8 to 12 h to provide sustained analgesia."
25255070,"Bup-SR provided plasma drug levels greater than the therapeutic level for the first 24 to 48 h after administration, but plasma levels of Bup-HCl fell below the therapeutic level by 4 h. Fent-SR maintained plasma levels greater than reported therapeutic levels for 12 h. Therapeutic levels of the remaining drugs are unknown, but Carp-SR provided plasma drug levels similar to those of Carp for the first 24 h after administration, whereas Melox-SR had greater plasma levels than did Melox for the first 8 h. Butp-SR provided detectable plasma drug levels for the first 24 h, with a dramatic decrease over the first 4 h. These results indicate that Bup-SR provides a stable plasma drug level adequate for analgesia for 24 to 48 h after administration, whereas Carp-SR, Melox-SR, Fent-SR, and Butp-SR would require additional doses to provide analgesic plasma levels beyond 24 h in mice."

The drop in synaptosomal pH effected by amiloride, an inhibitor of Na+/H+ exchange, and the transient rise in pH caused by ammonium chloride further suggested that synaptosomes may be a good model in the study of the regulation of intracellular pH. The elevation of cytosolic pH, and depression of oxygen radical formation by chlordecone, may result from both the attenuation of respiratory metabolism and an impaired capacity of the plasma membrane to maintain ionic gradients."

32892962,Autoantibodies which interfere with the function of the folate receptor alpha called folate receptor alpha autoantibodies have been identified in 58%-76% of children with ASD and independent studies have demonstrated that blood titers of these autoantibodies correlate with folate levels in the cerebrospinal fluid.
32892962,"Most significantly, case-series, open-label, and single and double-blind placebo-controlled studies suggest that d,l-leucovorin, a reduced folate that can bypass the blockage at the folate receptor alpha by using the reduced folate carrier, an alternate pathway, can substantially improve particular symptoms in children with ASD, especially those positive for folate receptor alpha autoantibodies."
28770615,Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) has been linked to abnormalities in folate metabolism.
28770615,Polymorphisms in folate genes may act in complex polygenic ways to increase the risk of developing ASD.

30555279,"As a calcium sensitizer and inodilator that augments cardiac contractility without increasing myocardial oxygen demand or exacerbating ischaemia, levosimendan may be well configured to deliver inotropic support in cases of acute heart failure (AHF)."
30555279,"Effects of levosimendan on systemic haemodynamics include its significant, dose-dependent increases in cardiac output, stroke volume and heart rate, and decreases in right and left ventricular filling and total peripheral resistance."
30555279,Rapid and sustained reduction in levels of natriuretic peptides is a consistent effect of levosimendan use and potentially favourable effects on other neurohormonal indicators of cardiac distress are also observed.
30555279,"Levosimendan has repeatedly been shown to be effective in relief of symptoms of AHF, notably dyspnoea and fatigue, while mortality data from clinical trials and registries suggest that levosimendan is markedly less likely than catecholaminergic inotropes to worsen prognosis."
30555279,"The vasodilator pharmacology of levosimendan is also pertinent to the drug's use in AHF, in which setting organ under-perfusion is often a key pathology."
30555279,These considerations suggest that levosimendan may have a more favourable impact on the circumstances of the majority of AHF patients than adrenergic agents that act only or primarily as cardiac stimulants.
30555279,"Levosimendan should be used with caution and with tightened haemodynamic monitoring in patients who have low baseline blood pressure (systolic blood pressure <100 mmHg; diastolic blood pressure <60 mmHg), or who are at risk of a hypotensive episode."

32690613,"After SCI, DRG neurons show hyperactivity and chronic depolarization of resting membrane potential (RMP) that is maintained by cAMP signaling through PKA and EPAC."
32690613,"Thus, depolarization-dependent C-Raf and downstream ERK activity maintain a depolarized RMP and nociceptor hyperactivity after SCI, providing a self-reinforcing mechanism to persistently promote nociceptor hyperexcitability and limit the therapeutic effectiveness of opioids."
